# Objective

The purpose of this technical test is to show a demonstration of my experience building a Javascript/cypress.io automation framework from scratch.

# Application under test (AUT)

This framework was built to test the following functions on the Automation Practice website http://automationpractice.com/index.php

* Order T-Shirt 
* Update Personal Information


# Running this test using cypress test runner

* Once code is cloned
* Download node.js if you haven't done so already (see - https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Download npm as well if you don't have it installed (see - https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
* Run command 'npm i' to install latest version of the packages bundled with this framework
* Execute 'npm run cy:open' to start cypress
* Please note that cypress has been configured in this framework to execute tests with extension '.feature' only.
* If you aren't familiar with executing cypress tests, please see - (https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests.html#Run-all-specs)
